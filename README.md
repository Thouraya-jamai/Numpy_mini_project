# Numpy-Project
This is my Project

# Project :
Let us build a complete project using NumPy (without any help).

Path: project_data = 'KAG_Conversion_Data.csv'

# Features:
ad_id: unique ID for each ad

xyzcampaignid: an ID associated with each ad campaign of XYZ company

fbcampaignid: an ID associated with how Facebook tracks each campaign

age: age of the person to whom the ad is shown

gender: gender of the person to whom the add is shown

interest: a code specifying the category to which the person’s interest belongs (interests are as mentioned in the person’s Facebook public profile)

Impressions: the number of times the ad was shown

Clicks: number of clicks on for that ad

Spent: Amount paid by company xyz to Facebook, to show that ad

Total conversion: Total number of people who enquired about the product after seeing the ad

Approved conversion: Total number of people who bought the product after seeing the ad

# Instructions:
Load the data. Data is already given to you in variable path

How many unique ad campaigns (xyzcampaignid) does this data contain ? And for how many times was each campaign run ?

What are the age groups that were targeted through these ad campaigns?

What was the average, minimum and maximum amount spent on the ads?

What is the id of the ad having the maximum number of clicks ?

How many people bought the product after seeing the ad with most clicks? Is that the maximum number of purchases in this dataset?

So the ad with the most clicks didn't fetch the maximum number of purchases. Find the details of the product having maximum number of purchases
